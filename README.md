- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Noah Duran and I have been in and around coding all my life.
     Iâ€™m interested in creating mobile and web applications to improve our world and help everyone
     to achieve their goals in the most convenient way possible while enjoying their lives to the fullest.
- ðŸŒ± I went to Coding Dojo to learn Full-Stack Web Development and loved every moment of and how front-end 
     and back-end work together to get the desired result. Teamwork is crucial in technology and being able
     see how everything works together in a seamless way is a good example of how teams in the real world should
     work.  I would love to collaborate with any interesting ideas or projects that anyone might be interested in
     pursuing.  letâ€™s work together and make the world a happier more fruitful experience for everyone.
